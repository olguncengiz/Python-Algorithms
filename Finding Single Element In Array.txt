'''
Assume that you have an array of integers. This array is not sorted and all elements occur twice but only one element occurs once. 

For Example: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 2, 3, 5, 1]

In this array, all elements but 5 occur two times, but 5 occurs only once.

The question is: how can you find this one element by looping through the array only once and holding 1 variable only?

    for i in range(len(a)):
        x = x ^ a[i]
    return x

a = list()
for i in range(10000):
    r = random.randint(1, 1000000000)
    if r not in a:
        a.append(r)
        a.append(r)

missing = a.pop()
random.shuffle(a)

x = findSingle(a)

print(x)
